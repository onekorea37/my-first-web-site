    <p> What's up, guys I'm Dowon. I am currently living in Canada.
    As you can see, I am into adventure stuff such as hiking, mountain biking and snowboarding.
    In addition to that, I am also fascinated with reading books. Am I too perfect guy? lol</p>


    <p>However, more than the ones listed above, I'm here to pursue my dream in Canada.
    If I want to success IT industry in South Korea where I'm from, It is honestly way harder than here.
    That's why I chose Canada and I managed to acquire permanent residency to reduce my college fee.</p>

    <p>I can summize my early 20's into university, military and traveling. I majored politics and I enjoed studying it.
    Having said that, it wasn't handy to get a job. After I served military service for 2 years. I made up my mind
    to explore the world. At that time I went to Japan, China, New zealand and Austrailia and so on...</p>

    <p>That's how I ended up living here in Canada. Well, more specifically, I'm plannign to live in Ottawa where is the capital city.</p>
    I hope I could be able to settle down here wherever I want.

    <br>Thanks!<br>
